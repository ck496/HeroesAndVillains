# HeroesAndVillains 

Universe for Heroes and Villains with characters, cities, liars and battle grounds. 
Heroes and Villains battle for the for the fate of the Universe.

## Design patterns
The listed patterns will work together one will handle the creational aspect of things and the other will handle the behaviors and communications between objects. 

### Builder:
 will be responsible of character and environment creation. Step by step creation of different complex objects within the universe
 
 ### Chain of Responsibilities: 
* Will handle all the interactions/communications between characters.
* Dialog, battle, attack, post-fight interactions will ala be handled with chain of responsibilities design
* Issue interactions with several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.


## Requirements 
The Design Patterns in the **bold** will handle the responsibilities listed after the **:**
* **Builder:** On Earth, there exists many cities where villains live and "spawn".
* **Builder:** New hot spots can spawn when one city gets too large. You need at least one city when your simulation starts.
* **Builder:** Every gang of villains will have their own lair in the city
* **Builder:** Heroes have their own bases and they also cooperate best in teams of 5. When there are more than 5 heroes, they will create a new base. 
	
* **Chain of Responsibilities:** Villains and Super Heroes battle each other when they run into each other (you can randomly make them meet how you see Ô¨Åt). The losers die and the winners take over the others strength. It is always a one on one battle. 
* **Chain of Responsibilities:** Each super hero and villain has powers. These powers are transferred when they battle and the winner gets the power of the one defeated. 
* **Chain of Responsibilities:**  Each person (no matter if villain or hero) needs to rest and recover, during these breaks they cannot battle and if they are attacked they will lose
* **Chain of Responsibilities:**  If the person defeated has a power the winner already has, just increase that power
